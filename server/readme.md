# User and Post Data Fetcher and Storer

## Overview

This project is a JavaScript application that fetches Users and their corresponding Posts data from the [https://dummyapi.io/data/v1/user](https://dummyapi.io/data/v1/user) API and stores it in a database. It uses an API key (app_id) for authentication.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js: [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)
- npm (Node Package Manager): Included with Node.js installation

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd my-data-fetcher-storer
   ```

3. Install project dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the project root directory and add your API key as follows:

   ```env
   API_KEY=your-api-key
   ```

   Replace `your-api-key` with the actual API key you obtained from the website.

5. Create a database and configure its connection details in the `.env` file. You can use any database of your choice (e.g., SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL).

   Example for SQLite:

   ```env
   DB_CONNECTION=sqlite
   DB_FILENAME=your-database.db
   ```

   Example for MySQL:

   ```env
   DB_CONNECTION=mysql
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_PORT=3306
   DB_USER=your-username
   DB_PASSWORD=your-password
   DB_DATABASE=your-database
   ```

6. Create the necessary database tables by running the database setup script:

   ```bash
   node src/db/db.js
   ```

## Usage

To fetch Users data from the API and store it in the database, run the main script:

```bash
node src/main.js
```

The script will fetch Users data from the API using your API key and store it in the `users` table in the database.

After fetching Users data, you can fetch their corresponding Posts data from the API and store it in the database using a similar process. Implement this functionality as needed in your code.

## Database Structure

The database structure will depend on your chosen database system and schema. Ensure that you create tables for Users and Posts, and establish the necessary relationships.
